          <p>DISCLAIMER: All items by HeartFELT Creations by Megs are handmade, therefore slight variations in color and design are to be expected. Part of the charm and appeal of handmade is special care given to each item. Each piece is unique in that respect. The artist tries very hard to maintain an overall consistent product, but it is impossible to control all aspects of the creative process, including but not limited to the slight variations in felt color and felt availability.</p>
