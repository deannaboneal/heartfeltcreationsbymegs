                <p>Hi, I'm Megs!<img src="images/family-photo.jpg" alt="family photo" id="family-photo"/></p> 
                <p>My mother taught me to sew and hand stitch when I was little, and I always admired the felt items that my grandmother used to make. Around Christmas in 2012, I was trying to come up with a unique present for my niece, and I thought felt food would be perfect since she was getting a play kitchen from her parents. I continued making felt food and toys for my sweet niece who was the recipient of many of my first creations.</p>
                <p>As a stay a home mom, it was important to provide opportunities for my girls to use their imaginations. Imaginative play is such an important part of early learning. I wanted to help them grow their imaginations and thought play food would be a great way to do so, but I didn't like the plastic options for many reasons. As my girls got older, I gradually grew my collection by leaps and bounds because they would give me ideas based on what they would like to have. Little did I know my felt food creations would grow from a beloved hobby into a career venture!</p>
                <p>I officially started HeartFELT Creations by Megs in January 2016. I design every item myself and often get much of my inspiration from photos of actual food. I also enjoy doing custom projects, as they help me exercise my creativity. I love the unique ideas my customers come up with, and I end up creating items I wouldn't normally come up with on my own. Each piece is made of a polyester mix, craft grade felt. They are also hand-stitched by me.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite nonfood projects was an Easter stained glass window countdown calendar that I created for myself. <img src="images/felt-stained-glass-window-countdown-calendar.jpg" alt="felt-stained-glass-window-countdown-Easter" id="favorite"/> When I first started the project, I was given a few odd looks when I described it. My friends and family weren't sure something like that could be created out of felt. Well, it can! And it looks amazing! I actually still have it hanging up in my basement because it's too pretty to pack away!</p>
